SymTable

This task is to create an ADT named SymTable. Each SymTable object must be a symbol table. A SymTable object must be generic. That is, a SymTable object must contain values which are void pointers, and thus can point to data of any type.

This contains two implementations of SymTable ADT: one that uses a linked list and another that uses a hash table.
